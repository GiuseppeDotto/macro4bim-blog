# Autocomplete Revit API Python code in VSCode

Hey everyone!

We wanted to share an update regarding how to generate **auto-completion** of Python code using the Revit API DB and pyRevit library in VSCode. Due to popular demand, we have compiled a handy YouTube video that walks through the process step-by-step. Hopefully, this is helpful to all of you!

Here's an **additional tip** for ðŸŽ¨ personalizing the look of VSCode.

Although Monokai is a popular theme, some users may prefer to remove the <span style="color:green">green underlines</span> for semantic highlighting. This will make it look more similar to the Python window in Dynamo. To achieve this, <span style="color:red">[min 3:20 in the above video]</span> navigate to the settings (JSON) and set the field "editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled" as false.

This will give you the desired look.

Very short yet functional,

Cheers!!
